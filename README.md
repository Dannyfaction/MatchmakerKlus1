We had an open assignment to make whatever we wanted to make, but it had to be a complete game made in a short time and with atleast 3 people. Everybody who tested the game enjoyed it a lot. We received a lot of feedback during the early greybox stages and processed this into a very fun game. We had little problems with the body dismemberment and lighting, but quickly came to solutions.

Honorable Scripts
* [Body Dismemberment](Scripts/Player/BodyDismemberment.cs)
* [Menu](Scripts/Menu/Menu.cs)
* [Camera Behaviour](Scripts/Camera/CameraBehaviour.cs)
* [Object Fader](Scripts/Camera/CameraObjectFader.cs)
